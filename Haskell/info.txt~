Start by typing ghci in the prompt
By default, the prompt is Prelude.
If I want it to be gchi -as the book- type
  :set prompt "ghci> "
If I want to change its default to start it directly,
create a .ghci file in the home folder and its content:
  :set prompt "ghci> "

BASIC CONCEPTS:

Laziness

FUNCTIONS:

- The order the funcitons get declared in a .hs file doesn't matter.
- Defined functions can call each other.
- An if in Haskell is not a statement, it is a expression:
  in order to be executed, requires an else.
- The apostrophe (') at the end of a function name doesn't have 
  any special meaning in Haskell's syntax, which means its a valid
  character top use in a function name. It is ude to denote either
  a strict version of a function (i.e. that it isn't lazy) or a
  slightly modified version of a function or a variable with a
  similar name.
